## Technical Details

### Stock Data Structure
```typescript
stock: {
  S: { Black: 15, White: 10 },
  M: { Black: 20, White: 15 },
  L: { Black: 18, White: 12 },
  XL: { Black: 12, White: 8 }
}
```

### Automatic Sync Logic
- When stock is updated, the system automatically:
  1. Calculates total stock across all sizes/colors
  2. Updates the `inStock` boolean flag
  3. Syncs changes to localStorage
  4. Triggers re-render across all components

### Data Persistence
- All changes are saved to browser localStorage
- Data persists between sessions
- No backend required - works entirely client-side

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check the dashboard for low stock alerts
2. **Batch Updates**: Make multiple changes before saving for efficiency
3. **Stock Levels**: Keep at least 5 items in stock to avoid low stock warnings
4. **Zero Stock**: Setting stock to 0 automatically marks products as "Out of Stock"

## Integration Points

The inventory system integrates with:
- **Homepage**: Product cards show stock status
- **Product Pages**: Availability and size selection
- **Checkout**: Prevents ordering out-of-stock items
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and alerts
